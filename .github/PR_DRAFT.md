## What this PR ships

This is two waves of work bundled into one ship:

### Wave 1 — `integrate-home-guide` consolidation (M2)
Sealed ~125 uncommitted files of in-flight work into 17 logical commits, plus a session-log update in GSD.md. No new features — just shape and reviewability for the home guidance rail, broker layer, mastery doctrine milestones, mission origin tags, upgrades scaffold, onboarding refresh, and PWA assets that were already in flight.

### Wave 2 — The Open World Awakens (Phases 1-8)
A canon-driven design pass that reveals the three-layer world structure (3 empires → 7 schools → 7 black market lanes) as the spine of every interaction. Documented in `docs/big-plan-open-world-awakens.md`.

| Phase | Headline | Key files |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Data foundation** | 3 empires + 7 schools as first-class data | `features/empires/`, `features/schools/`, +19 selector tests |
| **2. Routes** | `/empires`, `/empires/[id]`, `/schools`, `/schools/[id]` | 10 statically generated routes, 4 new screen components |
| **3. Dual-face cross-links** | Every sin lane → its open-face school in one click | `OpenFaceLink` rolled across all 7 lanes |
| **4. Mission origin resolution** | Mission origin badges link to their school HQ | `MissionOriginBadge` becomes a `Link` via `getSchoolForOriginTag` |
| **5. Doctrine pressure UI** | Zone pressure reads as "Held by the Bio Empire — Bonehowl, Flesh Thrones, Crimson Altars" | `ZoneDoctrinePressurePanel` |
| **6. First-session school affinity** | Players pick a school in `/new-game`; affinity badge surfaces on home | `SchoolAffinityPicker`, `AffinityBadge`, `SET_AFFINITY_SCHOOL` action |
| **7. Convergence wire-up** | Off-school visits silently feed the Book 6 fusion seed; one-shot anomaly toast fires globally | `applyCrossSchoolExposureToPlayer` helper, `RECORD_CROSS_SCHOOL_EVENT`, +12 tests |
| **8. Realtime mob loot parity** | Server-authoritative mobs always produce loot, even if `lootLines` is silent | `resolveAuthoritativeMobLoot` helper, +7 tests |

### Wave 3 — Sin Institutions (Phase 9)
The missing operating-org layer between schools and lanes. Each of the seven sins now has exactly one canonical institution that runs the school in the open AND the lane in the shadow. The layer answers "who actually profits when the player walks both faces of a sin?"

| Sin | Institution | Canon source |
|---|---|---|
| Wrath | **Bonehowl Syndicate** | Puppy spinoff (Discount Lars's org) |
| Gluttony | Court of the Sun-Mouth | game-specific |
| Envy | The Olympus Concord | game-specific |
| Lust | The Astarte Veil | game-specific |
| Greed | The Vishrava Ledger | game-specific |
| Pride | The Pharos Conclave | game-specific |
| Sloth | The Mandate Bureau | game-specific |

| Phase | Headline | Key files |
|---|---|---|
| **9. Sin Institutions** | Operating-org layer surfaced on every school HQ; canon-locked Bonehowl Syndicate + 6 game-specific entries flagged via `canonSource` | `features/institutions/`, `SchoolHqScreen` "Operating institution" section, +10 selector tests |
| **9 · unlock 1** | Brokers carry `institutionId`; `BrokerCard` shows the affiliation chip across 9 district screens | `features/lore/brokerData.ts`, `BrokerCard`, +8 join tests |
| **9 · unlock 2** | Mission origin tags carry `institutionId`; `MissionOriginBadge` hover reveals the full institution → school → nation lineage | `features/missions/missionOriginTags.ts`, `MissionOriginBadge`, +7 join tests |

## Player success criteria — all 13 pass

1. ✅ Open `/empires` and instantly see 3 empires
2. ✅ Click any empire and see its 2-3 child schools
3. ✅ Open `/schools` and see all 7 schools grouped by empire
4. ✅ Click any school: sin, nation, lane pairing, pressure identity, breakthrough condition
5. ✅ Walk into any black market lane → one click to its open-face school
6. ✅ Click any mission's origin tag → land at the school HQ
7. ✅ Read any zone's doctrine pressure as a school name, not a percentage triplet
8. ✅ Pick a school in `/new-game` and see it on the home command deck
9. ✅ Visit an off-empire school HQ and feel the convergence toast fire
10. ✅ Get loot from every realtime kill — even if the server forgets to send it
11. ✅ Read which institution actually runs each school + lane on the school HQ page
12. ✅ See which institution employs each broker on every district screen (chip in `BrokerCard`)
13. ✅ Hover any mission origin badge to see the full institution → school → nation lineage

New test files in this PR:
- `features/schools/schoolSelectors.test.ts` — 19 tests pinning the canonical 3-empire / 7-school / 7-lane structure
- `features/convergence/convergenceSeed.test.ts` — 12 tests pinning the cross-school exposure helper
- `features/void-maps/realtime/resolveAuthoritativeMobLoot.test.ts` — 7 tests pinning the mob loot parity fallback
- `features/institutions/institutionSelectors.test.ts` — 10 tests pinning the institution↔school↔lane↔sin joins
- `features/lore/brokerInstitution.test.ts` — 8 tests pinning broker↔institution joins (10 affiliated, 3 faction-less)
- `features/missions/missionOriginInstitution.test.ts` — 7 tests pinning mission origin↔institution joins (7 affiliated, 1 catch-all null)

## GSD status promotions

- **Void field (realtime shell)** 🟡 → 🟢 (Phase 8 closed the server mob parity gap and pinned it with tests)

Other 🟡 cells were not promoted — Phase 6-8 changes are additive, but the original verification flows still need actual browser smoke before promotion.

## Test plan
- [ ] Manual click-through: `/empires` → click each empire → click each school → verify dual-face link returns to the lane
- [ ] Manual click-through: `/schools` → all 7 schools render with correct sin/nation/lane
- [ ] Manual click-through: walk every black market lane → verify "Open face" link points to the right school
- [ ] Manual click-through: queue a mission with a non-`black-market-local` origin → click the origin badge → land at the right school HQ
- [ ] Manual click-through: visit a school HQ that doesn't match your empire → verify the AnomalyToast fires once
- [ ] Manual click-through: hunt in the void field → verify loot drops from server-authoritative mobs (the parity fix)
- [ ] Manual click-through: every school HQ shows the "Operating institution" section with the correct org and a "Canon" / "Game lore" chip (Bonehowl Syndicate alone is "Canon", others are "Game lore")
- [ ] Manual click-through: every district screen with brokers shows the institution chip on each affiliated broker (Mama Sol / The Warden / Nails are deliberately chipless)
- [ ] Manual hover: a non-`black-market-local` mission origin badge tooltip reads "[Institution] → [School] — [Nation] ([Pantheon]) · [material flavor]"
- [ ] New game flow: confirm step 2 requires both empire AND school affinity before advancing
- [ ] Confirm `npx next build` is clean post-merge
- [ ] Confirm `npm test` is clean post-merge

## Out of scope
- Mana mechanic (P1 in `VOID_WARS_SYSTEM_BACKLOG.md`) — not touched
- Pantheon system (P3) — partially seeded via `school.pantheon` field, full layer is future work
- Currency restructure (Sinful Coin / Ichor / Soul Crystals / Ironheart canon names) — separate concern
- War Exchange institutional pressure — institutions don't drive numbers yet; first economic hook is a future pass
- Mythic ladder gated by institutional influence — future depth slice
- Hearts vs Spades faction testing (Book 5 PvP) — separate game-mode scope

## Notes
- Branch is 41 commits ahead of `main`
- Working tree is clean except `.claude/settings.local.json` (intentionally excluded)
- Save shape additions (`affinitySchoolId`, `crossSchoolExposure`, `lastAnomalyToast`, `brokerCooldowns`, `activeRuns`) all have legacy-load normalizers in `gameStorage.ts` — pre-existing saves will hydrate cleanly with sensible defaults
- Phase 9 + both unlocks are pure-additive data + 3 UI surfaces (school HQ, broker card, mission origin tooltip) — no new state, no save migration, no behavior changes outside those renders
